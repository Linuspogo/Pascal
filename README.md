New Stanford Pascal Compiler

This is the new Stanford Pascal Compiler.
It runs on Windows, OS/2, Linux, MacOs and 
probably on every other system that has a C Compiler, 
because the generated P-Code is interpreted by the 
P-Code interpreter PCINT. 

It also runs on the IBM-Mainframe, on the operating systems
MVS and CMS (on Hercules) and on today's z/OS, too, although
limited to AMODE 24, at the moment. The P-Code is translated
to 370 machine code, there. 

On Windows, you can run the compiler using PP.CMD, which is
part of the repository.
